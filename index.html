      <p>I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns.</p>
      <p>from working as a full time military member travelling around the world to troublshooting small scale routers and switches. However since I started learning about coding everything changed.</p>

      <p>As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.</p>
